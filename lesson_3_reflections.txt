When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?  A remote repository is necessary to fascillitate collaboration with other individuals on a team as well as a way to keep your repo in a remotely accessible place that isn't tied down to whatever machine one may be using.  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?  You want control over what updates go up to GitHub, as they might affect the operational program.  This creates a dependency on the user to keep the updates flowing up to GitHub when necessary.
